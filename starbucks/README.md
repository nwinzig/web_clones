# Starbucks clone
This clone will recreate the landing page of starbucks.com

Elements will be as close to the original as possible including hover effects. It will not be responsive as it is a static clone on a standard 13in laptop. While elements have hover effects they will not link the user to anyother page if clicked.


## Screenshots for reference
